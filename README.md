# Building-A-TCP-Server-in-GOlang

Here is a simple program to make a TCP connection in GO. 

#To run the program
```console
go run main.go
```
#To make a connection with the server open another terminal and run the following command
```console
telnet localhost 3000
```
This will create a connection between the server and a cliend.

You can add as many clients as you can using this.
